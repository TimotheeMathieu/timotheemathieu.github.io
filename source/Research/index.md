### \# Topic of interest:
1. Robust statistics
2. Machine Learning
3. M-estimators
4. Non-parametric testing
5. Bandits and Sequential testing

### \# Libraries

I contribute to `scikit-learn-extra` library. See [the project on github](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/scikit-learn-extra).

Here is a small notebook to illustrate some of the applications developped during my PhD: [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yyGCgmif1EXBNLBgM0DaZvPLyHuJW8zf?usp=sharing).

<!-- ### \# Pet project -->

<!-- As a researcher, we use a lot of inequalities that we have to find and refind in old books. I decided to store some of them in a small wiki (powered by tiddlywiki, a very good personal wiki software) that you can find [here](https://timotheemathieu.github.io/inequalitieswiki/). -->
