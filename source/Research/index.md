### \# Libraries

I am one of the developers of `rlberry` library, a library for bandits and reinforcement learning for research and teaching. See [the project on github](https://github.com/rlberry-py/rlberry)

I contribute to `scikit-learn-extra` library, a `scikit-learn-contrib` repository which contains algorithms that are not mature enough for scikit-learn. See [the project on github](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/scikit-learn-extra).

Here is a small notebook to illustrate some of the applications developped during my PhD: [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yyGCgmif1EXBNLBgM0DaZvPLyHuJW8zf?usp=sharing).
